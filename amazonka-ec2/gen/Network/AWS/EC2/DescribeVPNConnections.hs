-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeVPNConnections' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dvpncFilters' - One or more filters.     * @customer-gateway-configuration@ - The configuration information for the customer gateway.     * @customer-gateway-id@ - The ID of a customer gateway associated with the VPN connection.     * @state@ - The state of the VPN connection (@pending@ | @available@ | @deleting@ | @deleted@ ).     * @option.static-routes-only@ - Indicates whether the connection has static routes only. Used for devices that do not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).     * @route.destination-cidr-block@ - The destination CIDR block. This corresponds to the subnet used in a customer data center.     * @bgp-asn@ - The BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with a BGP device.     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.     * @type@ - The type of VPN connection. Currently the only supported type is @ipsec.1@ .     * @vpn-connection-id@ - The ID of the VPN connection.     * @vpn-gateway-id@ - The ID of a virtual private gateway associated with the VPN connection.     * @transit-gateway-id@ - The ID of a transit gateway associated with the VPN connection.
--
-- * 'dvpncVPNConnectionIds' - One or more VPN connection IDs. Default: Describes your VPN connections.
--
-- * 'dvpncDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
