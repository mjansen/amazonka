-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeNetworkACLs' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dnaclFilters' - One or more filters.     * @association.association-id@ - The ID of an association ID for the ACL.     * @association.network-acl-id@ - The ID of the network ACL involved in the association.     * @association.subnet-id@ - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.     * @default@ - Indicates whether the ACL is the default network ACL for the VPC.     * @entry.cidr@ - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in the entry.     * @entry.icmp.code@ - The ICMP code specified in the entry, if any.     * @entry.icmp.type@ - The ICMP type specified in the entry, if any.     * @entry.ipv6-cidr@ - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in the entry.     * @entry.port-range.from@ - The start of the port range specified in the entry.      * @entry.port-range.to@ - The end of the port range specified in the entry.      * @entry.protocol@ - The protocol specified in the entry (@tcp@ | @udp@ | @icmp@ or a protocol number).     * @entry.rule-action@ - Allows or denies the matching traffic (@allow@ | @deny@ ).     * @entry.rule-number@ - The number of an entry (in other words, rule) in the set of ACL entries.     * @network-acl-id@ - The ID of the network ACL.     * @owner-id@ - The ID of the AWS account that owns the network ACL.     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.     * @vpc-id@ - The ID of the VPC for the network ACL.
--
-- * 'dnaclNextToken' - The token for the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dnaclNetworkACLIds' - One or more network ACL IDs. Default: Describes all your network ACLs.
--
-- * 'dnaclDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dnaclMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @nextToken@ value.
