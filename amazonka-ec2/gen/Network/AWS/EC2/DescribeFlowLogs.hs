-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeFlowLogs' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dflsNextToken' - The token for the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dflsFlowLogIds' - One or more flow log IDs. Constraint: Maximum of 1000 flow log IDs.
--
-- * 'dflsFilter' - One or more filters.     * @deliver-log-status@ - The status of the logs delivery (@SUCCESS@ | @FAILED@ ).     * @log-destination-type@ - The type of destination to which the flow log publishes data. Possible destination types include @cloud-watch-logs@ and @s3@ .     * @flow-log-id@ - The ID of the flow log.     * @log-group-name@ - The name of the log group.     * @resource-id@ - The ID of the VPC, subnet, or network interface.     * @traffic-type@ - The type of traffic (@ACCEPT@ | @REJECT@ | @ALL@ ).     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.
--
-- * 'dflsDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dflsMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @nextToken@ value.
