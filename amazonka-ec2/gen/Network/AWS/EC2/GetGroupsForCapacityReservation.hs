-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'ggfcrNextToken' - The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- * 'ggfcrDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'ggfcrMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned @nextToken@ value. This value can be between 5 and 500. If @maxResults@ is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error.
--
-- * 'ggfcrCapacityReservationId' - The ID of the Capacity Reservation.
