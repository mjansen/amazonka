-- Gets usage information about a Capacity Reservation. If the Capacity Reservation is shared, it shows usage information for the Capacity Reservation owner and each AWS account that is currently using the shared capacity. If the Capacity Reservation is not shared, it shows only the Capacity Reservation owner's usage.

--
-- * 'gcruDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--

This value can be between 5 and 500. If @maxResults@ is given a larger value than 500, you receive an error. Valid range: Minimum value of 1. Maximum value of 1000.

-- * 'gcrursState' - The current state of the Capacity Reservation. A Capacity Reservation can be in one of the following states:     * @active@ - The Capacity Reservation is active and the capacity is available for your use.     * @expired@ - The Capacity Reservation expired automatically at the date and time specified in your request.

A request might fail due to invalid request parameters, capacity constraints, or instance limit constraints. Failed requests are retained for 60 minutes.
