-- Stops advertising an address range that is provisioned as an address pool.
--
--
-- You can perform this operation at most once every 10 seconds, even if you specify different address ranges each time.
--
-- It can take a few minutes before traffic to the specified addresses stops routing to AWS because of BGP propagation delays.
