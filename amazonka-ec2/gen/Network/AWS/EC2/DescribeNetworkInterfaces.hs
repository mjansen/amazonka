-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeNetworkInterfaces' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dnisNetworkInterfaceIds' - One or more network interface IDs. Default: Describes all your network interfaces.
--
-- * 'dnisFilters' - One or more filters.     * @addresses.private-ip-address@ - The private IPv4 addresses associated with the network interface.     * @addresses.primary@ - Whether the private IPv4 address is the primary IP address associated with the network interface.      * @addresses.association.public-ip@ - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with the Elastic IP address (IPv4).     * @addresses.association.owner-id@ - The owner ID of the addresses associated with the network interface.     * @association.association-id@ - The association ID returned when the network interface was associated with an IPv4 address.     * @association.allocation-id@ - The allocation ID returned when you allocated the Elastic IP address (IPv4) for your network interface.     * @association.ip-owner-id@ - The owner of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) associated with the network interface.     * @association.public-ip@ - The address of the Elastic IP address (IPv4) bound to the network interface.     * @association.public-dns-name@ - The public DNS name for the network interface (IPv4).     * @attachment.attachment-id@ - The ID of the interface attachment.     * @attachment.attach-time@ - The time that the network interface was attached to an instance.     * @attachment.delete-on-termination@ - Indicates whether the attachment is deleted when an instance is terminated.     * @attachment.device-index@ - The device index to which the network interface is attached.     * @attachment.instance-id@ - The ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.     * @attachment.instance-owner-id@ - The owner ID of the instance to which the network interface is attached.     * @attachment.status@ - The status of the attachment (@attaching@ | @attached@ | @detaching@ | @detached@ ).     * @availability-zone@ - The Availability Zone of the network interface.     * @description@ - The description of the network interface.     * @group-id@ - The ID of a security group associated with the network interface.     * @group-name@ - The name of a security group associated with the network interface.     * @ipv6-addresses.ipv6-address@ - An IPv6 address associated with the network interface.     * @mac-address@ - The MAC address of the network interface.     * @network-interface-id@ - The ID of the network interface.     * @owner-id@ - The AWS account ID of the network interface owner.     * @private-ip-address@ - The private IPv4 address or addresses of the network interface.     * @private-dns-name@ - The private DNS name of the network interface (IPv4).     * @requester-id@ - The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).     * @requester-managed@ - Indicates whether the network interface is being managed by an AWS service (for example, AWS Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).     * @source-dest-check@ - Indicates whether the network interface performs source/destination checking. A value of @true@ means checking is enabled, and @false@ means checking is disabled. The value must be @false@ for the network interface to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.      * @status@ - The status of the network interface. If the network interface is not attached to an instance, the status is @available@ ; if a network interface is attached to an instance the status is @in-use@ .     * @subnet-id@ - The ID of the subnet for the network interface.     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.     * @vpc-id@ - The ID of the VPC for the network interface.
--
-- * 'dnisNextToken' - The token to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dnisDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dnisMaxResults' - The maximum number of items to return for this request. The request returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the next set of results. You cannot specify this parameter and the network interface IDs parameter in the same request.
