-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeReservedInstances' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'driFilters' - One or more filters.     * @availability-zone@ - The Availability Zone where the Reserved Instance can be used.     * @duration@ - The duration of the Reserved Instance (one year or three years), in seconds (@31536000@ | @94608000@ ).     * @end@ - The time when the Reserved Instance expires (for example, 2015-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).     * @fixed-price@ - The purchase price of the Reserved Instance (for example, 9800.0).     * @instance-type@ - The instance type that is covered by the reservation.     * @scope@ - The scope of the Reserved Instance (@Region@ or @Availability Zone@ ).     * @product-description@ - The Reserved Instance product platform description. Instances that include @(Amazon VPC)@ in the product platform description will only be displayed to EC2-Classic account holders and are for use with Amazon VPC (@Linux/UNIX@ | @Linux/UNIX (Amazon VPC)@ | @SUSE Linux@ | @SUSE Linux (Amazon VPC)@ | @Red Hat Enterprise Linux@ | @Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Amazon VPC)@ | @Windows@ | @Windows (Amazon VPC)@ | @Windows with SQL Server Standard@ | @Windows with SQL Server Standard (Amazon VPC)@ | @Windows with SQL Server Web@ | @Windows with SQL Server Web (Amazon VPC)@ | @Windows with SQL Server Enterprise@ | @Windows with SQL Server Enterprise (Amazon VPC)@ ).     * @reserved-instances-id@ - The ID of the Reserved Instance.     * @start@ - The time at which the Reserved Instance purchase request was placed (for example, 2014-08-07T11:54:42.000Z).     * @state@ - The state of the Reserved Instance (@payment-pending@ | @active@ | @payment-failed@ | @retired@ ).     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.     * @usage-price@ - The usage price of the Reserved Instance, per hour (for example, 0.84).
--
-- * 'driReservedInstancesIds' - One or more Reserved Instance IDs. Default: Describes all your Reserved Instances, or only those otherwise specified.
--
-- * 'driOfferingType' - The Reserved Instance offering type. If you are using tools that predate the 2011-11-01 API version, you only have access to the @Medium Utilization@ Reserved Instance offering type.
--
-- * 'driOfferingClass' - Describes whether the Reserved Instance is Standard or Convertible.
--
-- * 'driDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
