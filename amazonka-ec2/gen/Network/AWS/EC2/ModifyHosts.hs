-- Modify the auto-placement setting of a Dedicated Host. When auto-placement is enabled, any instances that you launch with a tenancy of @host@ but without a specific host ID are placed onto any available Dedicated Host in your account that has auto-placement enabled. When auto-placement is disabled, you need to provide a host ID to have the instance launch onto a specific host. If no host ID is provided, the instance is launched onto a suitable host with auto-placement enabled.
--
--
-- You can also use this API action to modify a Dedicated Host to support either multiple instance types in an instance family, or to support a specific instance type only.

-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'mhInstanceFamily' - Specifies the instance family to be supported by the Dedicated Host. Specify this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support multiple instance types within its current instance family. If you want to modify a Dedicated Host to support a specific instance type only, omit this parameter and specify __InstanceType__ instead. You cannot specify __InstanceFamily__ and __InstanceType__ in the same request.
--
-- * 'mhInstanceType' - Specifies the instance type to be supported by the Dedicated Host. Specify this parameter to modify a Dedicated Host to support only a specific instance type. If you want to modify a Dedicated Host to support multiple instance types in its current instance family, omit this parameter and specify __InstanceFamily__ instead. You cannot specify __InstanceType__ and __InstanceFamily__ in the same request.
--
-- * 'mhHostRecovery' - Indicates whether to enable or disable host recovery for the Dedicated Host. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-recovery.html Host recovery> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'mhAutoPlacement' - Specify whether to enable or disable auto-placement.
--
-- * 'mhHostIds' - The IDs of the Dedicated Hosts to modify.
