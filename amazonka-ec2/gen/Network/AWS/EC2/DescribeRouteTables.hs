-- Describes one or more of your route tables.

-- Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table. If a subnet is not explicitly associated with any route table, it is implicitly associated with the main route table. This command does not return the subnet ID for implicit associations.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeRouteTables' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'drtsFilters' - One or more filters.     * @association.route-table-association-id@ - The ID of an association ID for the route table.     * @association.route-table-id@ - The ID of the route table involved in the association.     * @association.subnet-id@ - The ID of the subnet involved in the association.     * @association.main@ - Indicates whether the route table is the main route table for the VPC (@true@ | @false@ ). Route tables that do not have an association ID are not returned in the response.     * @owner-id@ - The ID of the AWS account that owns the route table.     * @route-table-id@ - The ID of the route table.     * @route.destination-cidr-block@ - The IPv4 CIDR range specified in a route in the table.     * @route.destination-ipv6-cidr-block@ - The IPv6 CIDR range specified in a route in the route table.     * @route.destination-prefix-list-id@ - The ID (prefix) of the AWS service specified in a route in the table.     * @route.egress-only-internet-gateway-id@ - The ID of an egress-only Internet gateway specified in a route in the route table.     * @route.gateway-id@ - The ID of a gateway specified in a route in the table.     * @route.instance-id@ - The ID of an instance specified in a route in the table.     * @route.nat-gateway-id@ - The ID of a NAT gateway.     * @route.transit-gateway-id@ - The ID of a transit gateway.     * @route.origin@ - Describes how the route was created. @CreateRouteTable@ indicates that the route was automatically created when the route table was created; @CreateRoute@ indicates that the route was manually added to the route table; @EnableVgwRoutePropagation@ indicates that the route was propagated by route propagation.     * @route.state@ - The state of a route in the route table (@active@ | @blackhole@ ). The blackhole state indicates that the route's target isn't available (for example, the specified gateway isn't attached to the VPC, the specified NAT instance has been terminated, and so on).     * @route.vpc-peering-connection-id@ - The ID of a VPC peering connection specified in a route in the table.     * @tag@ :<key> - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key @Owner@ and the value @TeamA@ , specify @tag:Owner@ for the filter name and @TeamA@ for the filter value.     * @tag-key@ - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.     * @vpc-id@ - The ID of the VPC for the route table.
--
-- * 'drtsNextToken' - The token for the next page of results.
--
-- * 'drtsDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'drtsMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @nextToken@ value.
--
-- * 'drtsRouteTableIds' - One or more route table IDs. Default: Describes all your route tables.
