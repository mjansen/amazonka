--
-- Launches the specified number of instances using an AMI for which you have permissions.
--
--
-- You can specify a number of options, or leave the default options. The following rules apply:
--
--     * [EC2-VPC] If you don't specify a subnet ID, we choose a default subnet from your default VPC for you. If you don't have a default VPC, you must specify a subnet ID in the request.
--
--     * [EC2-Classic] If don't specify an Availability Zone, we choose one for you.
--
--     * Some instance types must be launched into a VPC. If you do not have a default VPC, or if you do not specify a subnet ID, the request fails. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#vpc-only-instance-types Instance types available only in a VPC> .
--
--     * [EC2-VPC] All instances have a network interface with a primary private IPv4 address. If you don't specify this address, we choose one from the IPv4 range of your subnet.
--
--     * Not all instance types support IPv6 addresses. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html Instance types> .
--
--     * If you don't specify a security group ID, we use the default security group. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html Security groups> .
--
--     * If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the user has not subscribed, the request fails.
--
--
--
-- You can create a <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html launch template> , which is a resource that contains the parameters to launch an instance. When you launch an instance using 'RunInstances' , you can specify the launch template instead of specifying the launch parameters.
--
-- To ensure faster instance launches, break up large requests into smaller batches. For example, create five separate launch requests for 100 instances each instead of one launch request for 500 instances.
--
-- An instance is ready for you to use when it's in the @running@ state. You can check the state of your instance using 'DescribeInstances' . You can tag instances and EBS volumes during launch, after launch, or both. For more information, see 'CreateTags' and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources> .
--
-- Linux instances have access to the public key of the key pair at boot. You can use this key to provide secure access to the instance. Amazon EC2 public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html Key pairs> .
--
-- For troubleshooting, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_InstanceStraightToTerminated.html What to do if an instance immediately terminates> , and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html Troubleshooting connecting to your instance> .

--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'risAdditionalInfo' - Reserved.
--
-- * 'risSecurityGroupIds' - The IDs of the security groups. You can create a security group using <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateSecurityGroup.html CreateSecurityGroup> . If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface.
--
-- * 'risSecurityGroups' - [EC2-Classic, default VPC] The names of the security groups. For a nondefault VPC, you must use security group IDs instead. If you specify a network interface, you must specify any security groups as part of the network interface. Default: Amazon EC2 uses the default security group.
--
-- * 'risClientToken' - Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you do not specify a client token, a randomly generated token is used for the request to ensure idempotency.

-- * 'risLicenseSpecifications' - The license configurations.
--
-- * 'risDisableAPITermination' - If you set this parameter to @true@ , you can't terminate the instance using the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API; otherwise, you can. To change this attribute after launch, use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceAttribute.html ModifyInstanceAttribute> . Alternatively, if you set @InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior@ to @terminate@ , you can terminate the instance by running the shutdown command from the instance. Default: @false@
--
-- * 'risKeyName' - The name of the key pair. You can create a key pair using <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKeyPair.html CreateKeyPair> or <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKeyPair.html ImportKeyPair> . /Important:/ If you do not specify a key pair, you can't connect to the instance unless you choose an AMI that is configured to allow users another way to log in.

--
-- * 'risEBSOptimized' - Indicates whether the instance is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides dedicated throughput to Amazon EBS and an optimized configuration stack to provide optimal Amazon EBS I/O performance. This optimization isn't available with all instance types. Additional usage charges apply when using an EBS-optimized instance. Default: @false@
--
-- * 'risUserData' - The user data to make available to the instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html Running commands on your Linux instance at launch> (Linux) and <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data Adding User Data> (Windows).

--
-- * 'risIPv6AddressCount' - [EC2-VPC] The number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign specific IPv6 addresses in the same request. You can specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
--
-- * 'risHibernationOptions' - Indicates whether an instance is enabled for hibernation. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html Hibernate your instance> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ . You can't enable hibernation and AWS Nitro Enclaves on the same instance.
--
-- * 'risIAMInstanceProfile' - The IAM instance profile.
--
-- * 'risElasticGpuSpecification' - An elastic GPU to associate with the instance. An Elastic GPU is a GPU resource that you can attach to your Windows instance to accelerate the graphics performance of your applications. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/elastic-graphics.html Amazon EC2 Elastic GPUs> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'risImageId' - The ID of the AMI. An AMI ID is required to launch an instance and must be specified here or in a launch template.
--
-- * 'risPrivateIPAddress' - [EC2-VPC] The primary IPv4 address. You must specify a value from the IPv4 address range of the subnet. Only one private IP address can be designated as primary. You can't specify this option if you've specified the option to designate a private IP address as the primary IP address in a network interface specification. You cannot specify this option if you're launching more than one instance in the request. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
--
-- * 'risInstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior' - Indicates whether an instance stops or terminates when you initiate shutdown from the instance (using the operating system command for system shutdown). Default: @stop@
--
-- * 'risMetadataOptions' - The metadata options for the instance. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html Instance metadata and user data> .

--
-- * 'risBlockDeviceMappings' - The block device mapping entries.
--
-- * 'risDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'risPlacement' - The placement for the instance.
--
-- * 'risIPv6Addresses' - [EC2-VPC] The IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
--
-- * 'risMaxCount' - The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above @MinCount@ . Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2 How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2> in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.
--
-- * 'risMinCount' - The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a minimum that is more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches no instances. Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2 How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2> in the Amazon EC2 General FAQ.

-- | The launch template to use to launch the instances. Any parameters that you specify in 'RunInstances' override the same parameters in the launch template. You can specify either the name or ID of a launch template, but not both.
risLaunchTemplate :: Lens' RunInstances (Maybe LaunchTemplateSpecification)
risLaunchTemplate = lens _risLaunchTemplate (\ s a -> s{_risLaunchTemplate = a})

-- | The credit option for CPU usage of the burstable performance instance. Valid values are @standard@ and @unlimited@ . To change this attribute after launch, use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification.html ModifyInstanceCreditSpecification> . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html Burstable performance instances> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ . Default: @standard@ (T2 instances) or @unlimited@ (T3/T3a instances)
risCreditSpecification :: Lens' RunInstances (Maybe CreditSpecificationRequest)
risCreditSpecification = lens _risCreditSpecification (\ s a -> s{_risCreditSpecification = a})

-- | The block device mapping entries.
risBlockDeviceMappings :: Lens' RunInstances [BlockDeviceMapping]
risBlockDeviceMappings = lens _risBlockDeviceMappings (\ s a -> s{_risBlockDeviceMappings = a}) . _Default . _Coerce

-- | Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
risDryRun :: Lens' RunInstances (Maybe Bool)
risDryRun = lens _risDryRun (\ s a -> s{_risDryRun = a})

-- | The placement for the instance.
risPlacement :: Lens' RunInstances (Maybe Placement)
risPlacement = lens _risPlacement (\ s a -> s{_risPlacement = a})

-- | [EC2-VPC] The IPv6 addresses from the range of the subnet to associate with the primary network interface. You cannot specify this option and the option to assign a number of IPv6 addresses in the same request. You cannot specify this option if you've specified a minimum number of instances to launch. You cannot specify this option and the network interfaces option in the same request.
risIPv6Addresses :: Lens' RunInstances [InstanceIPv6Address]
risIPv6Addresses = lens _risIPv6Addresses (\ s a -> s{_risIPv6Addresses = a}) . _Default . _Coerce

-- | The maximum number of instances to launch. If you specify more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches the largest possible number of instances above @MinCount@ . Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2 How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2> in the Amazon EC2 FAQ.
risMaxCount :: Lens' RunInstances Int
risMaxCount = lens _risMaxCount (\ s a -> s{_risMaxCount = a})

-- | The minimum number of instances to launch. If you specify a minimum that is more instances than Amazon EC2 can launch in the target Availability Zone, Amazon EC2 launches no instances. Constraints: Between 1 and the maximum number you're allowed for the specified instance type. For more information about the default limits, and how to request an increase, see <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#How_many_instances_can_I_run_in_Amazon_EC2 How many instances can I run in Amazon EC2> in the Amazon EC2 General FAQ.
