-- Describes the credit option for CPU usage of the specified burstable performance instances. The credit options are @standard@ and @unlimited@ .
--
--
-- If you do not specify an instance ID, Amazon EC2 returns burstable performance instances with the @unlimited@ credit option, as well as instances that were previously configured as T2, T3, and T3a with the @unlimited@ credit option. For example, if you resize a T2 instance, while it is configured as @unlimited@ , to an M4 instance, Amazon EC2 returns the M4 instance.
--
-- If you specify one or more instance IDs, Amazon EC2 returns the credit option (@standard@ or @unlimited@ ) of those instances. If you specify an instance ID that is not valid, such as an instance that is not a burstable performance instance, an error is returned.
--
-- Recently terminated instances might appear in the returned results. This interval is usually less than one hour.
--
-- If an Availability Zone is experiencing a service disruption and you specify instance IDs in the affected zone, or do not specify any instance IDs at all, the call fails. If you specify only instance IDs in an unaffected zone, the call works normally.
--
-- For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html Burstable performance instances> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ .
--
--
-- This operation returns paginated results.

-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeInstanceCreditSpecifications' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dicsFilters' - The filters.     * @instance-id@ - The ID of the instance.
--
-- * 'dicsNextToken' - The token to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dicsInstanceIds' - The instance IDs. Default: Describes all your instances. Constraints: Maximum 1000 explicitly specified instance IDs.
--
-- * 'dicsDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dicsMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return in a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @NextToken@ value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. You cannot specify this parameter and the instance IDs parameter in the same call.
