-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:

-- * 'dcpPoolIds' - The IDs of the address pools.

-- * 'dcpFilters' - The filters. The following are the possible values:     * @coip-pool.pool-id@      * @coip-pool.local-gateway-route-table-id@
--
-- * 'dcpNextToken' - The token for the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dcpDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dcpMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return with a single call. To retrieve the remaining results, make another call with the returned @nextToken@ value.
