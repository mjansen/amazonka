-- | Creates a value of 'CreateFleet' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'cfClientToken' - Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html Ensuring Idempotency> .
--
-- * 'cfSpotOptions' - Describes the configuration of Spot Instances in an EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'cfExcessCapacityTerminationPolicy' - Indicates whether running instances should be terminated if the total target capacity of the EC2 Fleet is decreased below the current size of the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'cfOnDemandOptions' - Describes the configuration of On-Demand Instances in an EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'cfTagSpecifications' - The key-value pair for tagging the EC2 Fleet request on creation. The value for @ResourceType@ must be @fleet@ , otherwise the fleet request fails. To tag instances at launch, specify the tags in the <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html#create-launch-template launch template> . For information about tagging after launch, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#tag-resources Tagging your resources> .
--
-- * 'cfValidUntil' - The end date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, /YYYY/ -/MM/ -/DD/ T/HH/ :/MM/ :/SS/ Z). At this point, no new EC2 Fleet requests are placed or able to fulfill the request. If no value is specified, the request remains until you cancel it.
--
-- * 'cfTerminateInstancesWithExpiration' - Indicates whether running instances should be terminated when the EC2 Fleet expires.
--
-- * 'cfType' - The type of request. The default value is @maintain@ .     * @maintain@ - The EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous request for your desired capacity, and continues to maintain your desired Spot capacity by replenishing interrupted Spot Instances.     * @request@ - The EC2 Fleet places an asynchronous one-time request for your desired capacity, but does submit Spot requests in alternative capacity pools if Spot capacity is unavailable, and does not maintain Spot capacity if Spot Instances are interrupted.     * @instant@ - The EC2 Fleet places a synchronous one-time request for your desired capacity, and returns errors for any instances that could not be launched. For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-configuration-strategies.html#ec2-fleet-request-type EC2 Fleet request types> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cfValidFrom' - The start date and time of the request, in UTC format (for example, /YYYY/ -/MM/ -/DD/ T/HH/ :/MM/ :/SS/ Z). The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately.
--
-- * 'cfReplaceUnhealthyInstances' - Indicates whether EC2 Fleet should replace unhealthy Spot Instances. Supported only for fleets of type @maintain@ . For more information, see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/manage-ec2-fleet.html#ec2-fleet-health-checks EC2 Fleet health checks> in the /Amazon EC2 User Guide/ .
--
-- * 'cfDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'cfLaunchTemplateConfigs' - The configuration for the EC2 Fleet.
--
-- * 'cfTargetCapacitySpecification' - The number of units to request.
